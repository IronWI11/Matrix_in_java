chat gpt: what are matrices used for in programming:
Matrices are used extensively in programming for a wide variety of applications, including:

    Image processing: Matrices are commonly used to represent digital images. Each pixel of an image can be represented as an element of a matrix, and various matrix operations can be applied to manipulate and process the image.

    Data analysis: Matrices are used to represent large sets of data, such as in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining applications.

    Computer graphics: Matrices are used to represent 3D transformations in computer graphics. By applying various matrix operations, it is possible to rotate, scale, and translate objects in 3D space.

    Scientific computing: Matrices are used to solve systems of linear equations, which are commonly found in scientific and engineering applications.

    Game development: Matrices are used to represent the positions, rotations, and scales of game objects. By applying matrix operations, it is possible to simulate movement and collisions between game objects.

Overall, matrices are a powerful tool in programming and can be used in a wide variety of applications where numerical computations and data manipulation are required.
